# memorize-flashcards
#
# A flashcard memorization software.
# This includes backend part that manages courses and cards via a python importable modules.
# It also includes a very simple console client that uses these modules.
#
# 2DO
# ====
# 1- Supply REST API for the backend- this would enable implementing different clients more
#    easily.
# 2- Re-implement the console client so it uses the REST api and not the python directly
# 3- Implement Web client/Android app client.
